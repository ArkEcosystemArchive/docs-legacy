# Archive

Various documentation and softare has been written by the ARK team and the community, for example the entirety of ARK V1's SDKs. As we are currently on V2, documentation on these subjects is less relevant and might confuse new developers. In the Archive you will find related files to this subject.

The contents of the Archive are not actively maintained. We accept PRs to fix mistakes and incorrect content, but we do not actively update it.
