# Introduction

Ark is all about ease of use - for end users, and for service providers. In our quest to provide simplicity for consumers and exchanges — we are proud to announce the development of [Ark RPC-Server](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/rpc-server), a customised Remote Procedure Call software, designed and developed by Ark with some key innovations that will be used in other Ark projects as well (more on that in section “Key Features”).

Most exchanges and third party services are familiar with BTC RPC when listing or adding a cryptocurrency. Since Ark is a custom blockchain, many services have had difficulty navigating through our GitHub and integrating Ark into their platform. Now, the addition of Ark RPC will give all exchanges and third party service providers a more familiar path to integrate Ark into their platform.

The two most popular means of accessing the Ark blockchain are via the Public API and the JSON-RPC. Though the Public API is the recommended approach, we include instructions here on how to accomplish the most common tasks on both API surfaces.

We have added "quick guides" to walk you through the process of interacting with the Ark blockchain in each API.
