# Intro to Core
In this section you'll find information relevant to developing on the Ark Core platform.

The most recent [development branch](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/core/tree/develop/) for Ark Core has been refactored to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/); the development environment is therefore slightly different than what the rest of this section describes.

It is recommended that you take a look at the [development](./development.html) guide within this section, which has been updated to reflect changes on the new development requirements.
