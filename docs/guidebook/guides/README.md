# Introduction

Here you will find different guides on using various components of ARK, such as the web wallet and core-commander. These guides do not require an understanding of programming, in-depth cryptography or other technical skills. However, we do recommend reading the [basics](/introduction/blockchain/) on blockchain before actually transferring funds or working with your private key.

ARK aims to be user-friendly and having the different GUI application be self-explanatory. Due to the permanent nature of the blockchain, and the inability to revert mistakes, we provide these guides.

::: warning

Be aware that, although the guides are quite user-friendly, funds may be lost in the case of misuse. **Always store your full passphrase, all 12 words**.
