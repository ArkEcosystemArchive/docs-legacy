# Summary

ARK `v2.2` is a minor update, backward compatible with `v2.1.X`. This update introduces a [Command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), which providers node maintainers and delegates all the tools they need to manage their nodes. It is more convenient to use then the old [Core Commander](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/core-commander) and easier to maintain for updates.

* **Upgrade time**: low - upgrading to `v2.2` does not break any APIs and can be performed incrementally in the network.
* **Complexity**: low - the internal blockchain representation is not altered.
* **Risk**: low - `v2.2` is backward compatible with `v2.1`.
