# Summary

ARK `v2.5` is a minor update and backward compatible with `v2.5.X`. This update removes the legacy public API that was ported from `ark-node`.

- **Upgrade time**: low - upgrading to `v2.5` requires no changes.
- **Complexity**: low - only legacy code was removed and numerical format issues resolved.
- **Risk**: medium - applications that relied on the legacy API will stop working. _An announcement was made that the legacy public API will be removed last year so the risk of this should be low._
