title: Deployer Tutorials
---

This guide is to help you get set up with your own ARK BridgeChain. It will focus on launching your blockchain, auto-forging setup, adding Delegate Nodes and using the official wallet to manage your funds.

The Relay and Delegate nodes are a core part of the network. They are what forge the blocks, validate transactions, provide API access to the data contained within the network, and ultimately what keeps everything running and secure. Nodes can run [bare metal](/tutorials/deployer/deployer.md), inside a [virtual machine](/tutorials/deployer/vagrant.md) or a [container](/tutorials/deployer/docker.md). Each installation relies on our [deployer](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/deployer), which makes it trivial to configure your network.

Start these tutorials by setting up a network [manually](/tutorials/deployer/deployer.md), using the deployer script on a bare-metal server. This gives you insights into the configurations and inner workings of ARK.
