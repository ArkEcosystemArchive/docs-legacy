# How To Vote/Un-Vote In the ARK Desktop Wallet

[[toc]]

You can use your ARK to vote or un-vote a delegate. In this guide, we’ll show you how to vote for a delegate, or un-vote a delegate if you want to change your vote.

Some basic voting info :

- *1 ARK address can vote for only  one delegate at a time.* If you wish to vote for more than one delegate you can create multiple wallets, split your ARK among those wallets and vote for a different delegate with each wallet. For example, if you have 1000 ARK, you can vote for one delegate with all of your ARK in one wallet, or you can divide your ARK into two wallets of 500 ARK each and vote for two different delegates. You can create as many wallets as you want and divide your ARK among them in any proportion you choose.
- *1 ARK equals a voting weight of 1.* The more ARK you hold, the more voting weight you possess. If you split your ARK into multiple wallets, your voting power divides proportionally among those wallets. For example, if you have 1,000 ARK your voting power is equal to 1,000 ARK. If you split your ARK into two wallets, each will have a voting power of 500 ARK.
- *Each vote or un-vote comes with a fee.* Each transaction in the ARK network costs a certain amount of ARK. With the implementation of dynamic fees, this cost will become adjustable. You can choose how much you want to spend for each specific transaction, even for voting and for un-voting.

## Whom to Vote for?

First of all, read the [Delegate Proposals](https://forum.ark.io/category/5/delegates) on our forum. From the current list of delegates, vote according to your preferences.

You can also see the list of currently active delegates on our [delegate monitor](https://explorer.ark.io/delegateMonitor).

## Casting a Vote

Open the ARK Desktop Wallet and select the wallet you wish to vote with. The wallet can be chosen from the menu on the right.

In the delegate selection window, you can scroll up or down to view the full list of active delegates (51 are currently responsible for validation and creation of new blocks).

Now, you can select your ‘voting fee' for this specific voting transaction. You can choose from a predefined range of fees or input a custom fee that you wish to pay for voting. Note that if you select a fee that is too low, it will not be accepted by any of the currently active delegates.  If no delegate accepts your transaction, it will not be confirmed and will remain in the transaction pool for 45 minutes before being dropped. After selecting your voting fee, input your wallet passphrase and press ***Next*** to continue.
